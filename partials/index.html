                <h1>Javascript Basics</h1>
                <p>Javascript is a cross platform, object-oriented scripting languages. Javascript is extreamly popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developersto take it in a buch of different directions.Javascript lives inside of a bost environment (Web browser or a Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environment to provide programming control over them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="/">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are containers for strong data values- imagine a cup fill you with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable hold a value. All Javascript variables must me identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span></li>
                    <li><a href="/">Variable Assignment</a> Assignments operators assign values to Javascript variables - our cup now can have the coffee poured in it, giving our variables a value to hold. The = assignment operator assign a value to a variables. <span>var x = 10</span> </li>
                    <li><a href="/">Data Type</a>Data types are important concepts; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. These are six data types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']</span> and object <span>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
                    <li><a href="/">Conditional</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statement in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statement: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code blocks; <span>if else</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false, <span>else</span> we execute this block of code.</li>
                    <li><a href="/">Loops</a> There are many different types of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times, Imagine you have a to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                    <li><a href="/">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instruction. As an example imagine we are putting together desk from a Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly, there are a ton more instructions to do so lets call our functions over and over again.</li>
